# Activating Block SIM

To ensure that the Block SIM application works correctly, you must activate it by following the steps described in this document:

1. Make sure that the SIM card slot is empty. If you have a SIM card installed, remove all the SIM cards from the phone.&#x20;
2. Insert the CHIP you are going to use to activate the Block SIM into the SIM card slot 1 of the phone.

**IMPORTANT**

Make sure that only the chip provided is inserted into the correct slot. If this is not done, your private SIM card may be blocked, making it impossible to use.
{% endhint %}

When registering the device with the Android - Block SIM management mode, using one of the registration methods detailed in the User Manual, the Block SIM application will appear in the list of working applications, as shown in the image below, and after activating **Datamob Enterprise** , the Block SIM application will be installed automatically and will be available on the device:

When you open Block SIM, you will see the screen below with a status of Completed, as the **Datamob Enterprise** application has already been installed to communicate with Block SIM.

3. After opening the Block SIM application, activate all the permissions on the screen as follows:

* **Accessibility**

1. Click on the "Open settings" button, after which a message will appear in which you must select the "Accept\*\*"\*\* option .
2. The application will display the Accessibility activation screen, so we must activate it by dragging the key to the side and clicking ALLOW in the message that will be displayed immediately after activation. This is how we grant the application permission to use the Accessibility feature.
3. After activating, click the "Back" button on your phone repeatedly until you reach the application activation flow again.

* **Admin**

1. Click on "Open settings", the application will display the activation screen for the cell phone administrator, click on the option "Activate the administrator app for this device".
2. Once activated, we will automatically return to the application activation flow screen.

* **Phone calls**

This permission is automatically configured by the policies sent from the portal, so during activation, the app will already display this "Done" step and move on to the next permission that requires user action.

* **Screen lock**

This configuration is carried out automatically by the policies sent from the portal, so during activation, the app will already display this "Done" step and move on to the next permission that requires user action. If for some reason the configuration is not done automatically by the portal, the user will need to configure it manually, removing all screen locks and leaving the "None" password option.

* **Screen overlay**

1. Click on "Open settings" and the screen below will appear \*\*,\*\* click on the Block SIM app to display the screen where you will be granted permission to overlay the app.
2. Enable the "Allow overlap with other apps" switch to grant the app permission

* **Chip blocking**

1. Click on the "Block SIM card" button and wait for the application to block it automatically.

**NOTE**

After clicking on "BLOCK CHIP", you should avoid any interaction with the device. Let the blocking process complete automatically without any interference. Failure to do so could jeopardize the effectiveness of creating the CHIP lock.
{% endhint %}

2. Once the SIM lock configuration has been completed, the following screen will be displayed to the user. This screen allows the user to register a password on the Block SIM that will be used to lock the screen to access the device, guaranteeing the security of its use. After registering, the user can close the application and use the device as normal.
3. Enter the new lock PIN and confirm by entering it again.
4. If you want to change the screen lock password, simply open the Block SIM app again and enter a new password.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**IMPORTANT**

To ensure that Block SIM works correctly, we strongly recommend that users do not create passwords or screen locks in the device settings, as this could cause problems with the way the CHIP unlocks, misusing the solution and even causing the CHIP to be locked with a PUK that the user does not have access to. We therefore advise you to avoid making any changes to the device's screen lock to ensure the stability and proper functioning of the SIM Block.
{% endhint %}



Once you have carried out all the steps to configure and activate the Block SIM, you can use your device as normal, ensuring that your CHIP is put to good use.
