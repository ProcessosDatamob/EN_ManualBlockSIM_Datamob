### Android - Block SIM <a href="#heading-h.cdgsk02n5ih4" id="heading-h.cdgsk02n5ih4"></a>

The Android management mode - Block SIM, allows you to manage Android device settings and policy controls. It automatically adds the Block SIM application with a forced installation type, i.e. when you register, the application will already be installed without the need for user action.

**IMPORTANT**

The Android management mode policy - Block SIM, restricts the creation and modification of the device password to ensure the correct functioning of the Block SIM App. The user can create a screen lock password directly in the Block SIM app to maintain the security of their device.
{% endhint %}

Below, we can see that the tab with the "Password Restrictions" option is disabled for settings because the policy management mode is Android - Block SIM.
